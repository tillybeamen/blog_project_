TITLE: Tillman's Blog!

My motivation for this project was quite simple, I always wanted to start a blog. I love to write. I have thousands of journal entries over the years.
Journaling my day to day or writing poetry. As I researched project ideas and what was possible to create in the MERN stack, 
a blog site seemed to be the best fit for me.

I built this blog page because I want to create a platform for myself initially, later on I would like to have many users logged in,
which would allow for creative and artistic freedom of expression.

During the creation of this project I learned more creative ways to use CSS as this was my first project that relied heavily on 
CSS compared to bootstrap. I also learned a lot more about file structure and modularization along with linking routes to one another. 
Such as directly targeting the first letter of a p tag and adding margin and font weight to make things stand out a bit. I learned 
how important it is to give everything a detailed class name so I could target specific areas in my CSS to style and so I had some structure and readability.

The CSS I believe will really make my project stand out as I spent the most time fine tuning it.

The biggest challenge I faced while building this page was trying to implement a login and registration portion
for many different users to login and post their own blogs, add their own profile pictures, update their account information and profile picture.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
